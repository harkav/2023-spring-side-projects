# 2023-spring-side-projects

This semester I Want to try the following side projects: 

1 A workout app that tracks progress in strength exercises such as deadlifts 

2. A counter that tracks days since the last time my flatmate tried to burn down the place 

3. Some kind of easy converter 

4. A portofoglio/about-me page 

5. A tracker app for my caffein intake and sleep 

5 other possible projects: A battleship game, an app for memorizing latin verb-conjugations and/or noun and adjective declensions, a reservation system for 
hotels, some sentiment analysis project, an app that tracks my use of [snus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snus) (swedish smoke-free tobacco. 

I also thought about a few other projects that I do not intend to prioritize this semester

Shopping list 
An app that tracks my bonds 
An app that displays some kind of quotes 
A tokenizer 
An n-gram app
